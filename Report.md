# LCG (Linear Congruential Generator)
  # Introduction
  LCG is a type of Pseudorandom number generator where numbers are generated within a specific range.
  It is called pseudorandom and not random because at the end of the day there is an arithmetic procedure to generate the numbers.

  # Math behind LCG
  It follows the formula:

  First, a seed value should be chosen, and then an 'm' (modulus) value and the according a and c values.
  
  The equation resembles linear congruence which is of the form:

  but what exactly is congruence?
